# Tic-Tac-Toe_v2
Tic-Tac-Toe game JavaScript ES5 & ES6

To run this game is a very simple process:

1.	Install Node.js (Includes node package manager) This is the JavaScript runtime environment needed to run javascript code without html or css.
It also includes npm, which will install packages like readline-sync.

2.	In the project folder open terminal and run “npm install” to dependencies (listed in package.json and packagelock.json) this helps ensure consistency across different environments, like if someone clones the repository.

3.	a text editor like vscode, not essential for the game to run but helpful for reviewing and editing code.

4.	Once the dependencies are installed, type “node ticTacToe.js” into the console to run the game.
